Sinhala Character Extraction using Image Processing
Overview
This repository contains code and resources for extracting Sellipi characters from images using image processing techniques. The focus is on the Sinhala script, specifically the Sinhala script used in Sri Lanka, known as Sinhala Sellipi.




Introduction


Sinhala Sellipi is the writing system used for the Sinhala language in Sri Lanka. This project aims to develop a robust character extraction algorithm using image processing techniques. The extraction process involves detecting and isolating individual Sinhala characters from images.
